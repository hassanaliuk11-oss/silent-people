            title: "A Funeral of the Soul", 
            content: `Loneliness walks beside love
like a shadow that learned my name
It does not shout or hurry
it only stays
breathing where promises once lived
Betrayal arrives quietly
wearing the face of trust
It knows the language of the heart
and speaks it fluently
until meaning collapses
I loved with open hands
never counting the cost
never locking the door of my soul
I believed love was shelter
not a battlefield of intentions
But loneliness grows inside love
when truth is replaced by excuses
when eyes stop meeting eyes
and silence learns to lie
Betrayal is not a single moment
it is a slow forgetting
a delayed response
a warmth that turns cold
without warning
I died many times without a grave
each time you chose yourself over us
each time my name lost its importance
in your changing priorities
Loneliness is not being alone
it is being unseen
being unheard
being loved only in words
never in presence
Love begins to suffocate
when loyalty becomes optional
when promises become flexible
and hearts become temporary homes
I carried your absence
even when you were near
your body stayed
but your soul had already left
taking my peace with it
Betrayal teaches love how to bleed
without leaving visible wounds
It teaches the heart
to smile while breaking
to live while dying
Loneliness whispers at night
asking questions without answers
Was I not enough
Was my love too real
for a world that loves convenience
Death in love is not dramatic
It happens in ordinary days
between unread messages
and postponed meetings
between almost and never
I stopped expecting
because hope became painful
Every expectation felt like
another invitation to collapse
Loneliness became my companion
sitting beside me in crowded rooms
reminding me
that abandonment can exist
even in arms that hold you
Betrayal rewrites memories
turning sacred moments
into evidence of foolish trust
It makes the past hurt more
than the present
Love dies slowly
when honesty disappears
when effort becomes one sided
when care feels like a favor
I did not stop loving you
I stopped surviving it
My heart grew tired
of proving its worth
to someone who already knew it
Loneliness did not kill me
betrayal did
Loneliness only stayed
to watch it happen
silently
Now I breathe differently
with guarded hopes
and quieter dreams
I love carefully
as if love itself can be lethal
If I ever love again
it will be without begging
without shrinking
without losing myself
to someone else’s comfort
Because loneliness taught me pain
but betrayal taught me death
and love
should never feel like
a slow funeral of the soul`

My world finds its meaning
In the magic of your words
My every breath moves

Every moment in your memory

If you return even once
Perhaps separation will stop being death`

Life slips away quietly
When love becomes everything

I am still alive to the world
But to myself
I am gone
Because in true love
Losing your life
Means finding a soul`

Haunt the corners of my heart
Where words dare not wander

It trembles with unshed tears

Yet, in that fear
I find a strange truth
That even in silence
My heart beats only for you`

My heart cries
But hidden in the sweetness of love
It embraces every sorrow silently`

The night becomes eternal`

Not in blood, but in silence`

Perhaps now
My heart will give up
But morning arrives
And my eyes still open

Maybe love does not kill
It only takes away
Every easy way
To keep living

I am alive
This is not happiness
It is only a question
Repeated
With every breath

I would surely die
That thought was true

Is the greatest pain`

The sound of its footsteps

Some pains exist

Settle

I am a human scattered into words
Inside the room of my heart

Where silence

I walk among people
Wearing a smile
And at night
I break apart
Under the weight
Of my own questions

There are secrets in my chest
That want to scream
But the edges of my eyes
Force them
Into silence

I am that night
Where the moon exists
But the light is incomplete
And the stars
Stand as witnesses

I am a dream
Soaked in tears
Seen by an awakened heart
That shattered
And dissolved
Into silence`

There was no sound
Only a silence

Of staying forever
Did not even turn back
When he left

I surrendered myself
In your name
And you turned
Silence
Into my destiny

Now my heart
Does not complain to anyone
It simply breathes
Slowly
Under the weight of memories

Love taught me
That those who give everything
Often remain empty
And those who break
Are the ones called
True lovers

I still do not speak ill of you
It is only my heart
That refuses to accept
That you were ever mine`

Keeps breathing

You live in my thoughts
And perhaps that is why
I am not
Complete within myself

You do not return as memories

There is only empty air
Yet my heart insists
You are here
Just without permission to be touched

You do not speak
Yet every silence
Whispers your name
Every moment
Carries the weight
Of your memory

You are not with me
Yet you feel present
Perhaps that is why
Even separation
Is never
Fully accepted

I am alive

Turned into a thought

Inside me`

Sometimes sleep
Sometimes peace
Sometimes the feeling
Of being whole within myself

I will remain alive
That is what people will believe
But inside
A voice
Will slowly
Fade into silence

I will die remembering you
Because some separations
Do not bury the body
They bury the heart

This is the hardest way to live
That breath continues
While the heart
Remains
Somewhere behind`

Come to you
And quietly
Come to rest

You live in my heart

Even when I smile
Sadness
Settles in my eyes

You do not arrive as memories

You turn into my heartbeat

Never truly

Yet every heartbeat
Testifies
To your presence

Sometimes
My heart seems to pause
Perhaps wondering
If you did not exist
For whom
Would this heartbeat live

You have become my heartbeat
And this is not happiness
It is a habit
That does not leave
Even after separation

Because some loves
Do not take space in the heart
They become
The heart itself`
